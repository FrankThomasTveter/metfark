The data contained in the farkRPackage R package was analyzed exactly like detailed in this document.

First, because the data is contained in a package, we can easily call it from R

```{r}
library(farkRPackage)
head(exampleData)
```

We drew a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(score ~ group, data = exampleData)
```

And conducted a t-test:

```{r}
t.test(score ~ group, data = exampleData)
```

Thank you for reading.
